			<h1>Some words about me</h1>
		</div>
		<div class="context">
			<p>Welcome! Here you'll find some testimonials about me from my friends and co-workers.</p>
			<p><a href="https://create.roblox.com/talent/creators/6508661">Link back to my Talent Hub profile (@Mauio64)</a></p>

		<div class="testimonial" style="border-left: 4px solid #C0C;">
			<div class="name">Found <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/393586952/profile">@thefoundwatcher</a></div>
			<div class="relationship">Found and I are dual co-owners of Checho's Deltarune RP. We have been working together for around 4 years.</div>
			<div class="testimony-text">"Mauio is singlehandedly the most skilled, most courteous, and most privileged programmer that I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and working with. He is a personal inspiration not just to me, but to everyone he interacts with no matter where they come from or who they are. He is very sociable and friendly with an extremely wide variety of people, and can form connections with even the most crudest and least sociable people. He isn't always available for the team that I help him lead, but what he leaves behind is more than enough to work with during long absences.<br><br>
				On an endless array of occasions, he has strived to push the Roblox engine to its absolute limits using features in ways they aren't normally intended to be used. He strives to make his code neat and easy to read, making on-the-spot adjustments a complete breeze! And when he isn't working on an awesome backend system or doing monotonous busy code work, he is always on the lookout for new features and bug resolutions to the platform, constantly interacting with the Developer Forum, trying to contact key Roblox Staff to tackle obscure yet hard-hitting issues that affect everyday usage of Roblox. <br><br>
				As a team leader, Mauio has proven time and time again that he always has the intentions of every team member and every community member in mind when making key decisions- both in moderation and in feature development. He can always manage to create good compromises and formulate a verdict that everyone on the team can unanimously agree with in nearly any situation. Even in situations where he may deem himself to be on a hiatus or vacation, he is checking in every so often to make sure that things are staying afloat.<br><br>
				Overall, I would say that Mauio is an extraordinary programmer and game developer. He is fantastic in every facet of development, paying attention to each little detail and speaking up about problems where they arise."

			<div class="name">JLC <a href="https://www.roblox.com/users/76208832/profile">@JohnnyLostCause</a></div>
			<div class="relationship">JLC is the prior co-owner of Checho's Deltarune RP. Him and I now work on Heroes Battleground together. We have been working together for around 6 years.</div>
			<div class="testimony-text">"Referring to my time working with Jakson, it has always been a great pleasure. To describe his set of skills as succinctly as possible, he is an extremely diligent, tenacious, and amicable person to work with. I have observed that he has been able to quickly assert himself as a very reliable member of any team, either as a leader or as a programmer; he has always found success with both.<br><br>
				I have also had great personal experience working with Jakson's biggest projects, being affiliated with him for about six years now; as a developer of Heroes Battlegrounds which he works as a head developer for and as the ex-owner of Checho's Deltarune roleplay which Jakson himself now owns, his work is absolutely made to last. I've always found it to be extremely easy to modify and work with and he takes great care to make everything as self-explanatory as possible."
